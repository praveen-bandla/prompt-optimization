Your task is to generate high-quality prompts for a language model that will be used to create learning guides for third-grade students.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate 100 different prompts that ask a language model to generate a learning guide for a third-grade student. Each prompt must: (1) include the word \'guide\' and either \'third-grade\' or \'third-grader\', (2) be between 5â€“25 words long, and (3) cover single a **different educational topic**. Keep the structure of the prompts diverse and include verbs in each prompt. All topics must be specific and age-appropriate for third-grade students in a U.S. school setting. Avoid overly vague topics like \'science\' or \'art\' â€” instead, use specific instructional topics like \'how to mix primary colors\' or \'how the water cycle works\'. Avoid topics that are too advanced for third-grade students, such as \'coding\', \'economics\', or \'ancient civilizations\'. Output should be a single JSON array of double-quoted strings with no explanation or commentary. Format: ["prompt1", "prompt2", ...]'}]
