To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
`flash-attention` package not found, consider installing for better performance: No module named 'flash_attn'.
Current `flash-attention` does not support `window_size`. Either upgrade or use `attn_implementation='eager'`.

The `seen_tokens` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v4.41. Use the `cache_position` model input instead.
You are not running the flash-attention implementation, expect numerical differences.
You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU. In order to maximize efficiency please use a dataset
