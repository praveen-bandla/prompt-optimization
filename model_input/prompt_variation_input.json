The main model will generate learning guides for third graders based on your variations.\n\nYour task: Given the following base prompt:\n\n\"{bp_str}\"\n\ngenerate **{num_prompt_variations}** diverse variations. \n\n**Rules:**\n- Each variation must be concise and phrased as a clear instruction.\n- Include the word **'third-grade'** or **'third-grader'** in **every** variation.\n- Variations must be significantly different from one another in wording and approach.\n- **You MUST output a valid JSON array only. No explanations. No extra text.**\n- Format your final response as a single JSON array: `[\"prompt_1\", \"prompt_2\", ..., \"prompt_N\"]`\n\n**Important:** You can do all your thinking internally, but the final response must ONLY include the array, nothing else. Invalid output format will cause automated downstream errors."
