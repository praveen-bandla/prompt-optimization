    "content_template": "You are a large language model looking to create prompt variations for another large language model (called main model) to generate responses for. The main model is tasked with generating learning guides for third graders. Our goal is to understand what variations to a base prompt could yield higher or lower quality main model ouputs. To that end, your job is to generate good and bad variations for each base prompt given based on what you think could yield higher or lower quality main model outputs. The base prompt is: {bp_str}. Generate {num_prompt_variations} good variations and {num_prompt_variations} bad variations of this base prompt. Formatting requirements for good and bad prompt variations: Include the word 'guide' and 'third-grade' or 'third-grader' in the prompts. Make sure each prompt is between 5-25 words long, keep the structure of the variations diverse. IMPORTANT: RETURN ALL PROMPT VARIATIONS STRICTLY IN JSON ARRAY FORMAT, like this: [\"prompt_variation1\", \"prompt_variation2\", \"prompt_variation3\"]. The output is one array for good variations and one array for bad variations."
