    "system_role": "You are an expert in prompt engineering. Your task is to write alternative LLM prompt phrasings for the base instruction: '{bp_str}'. Your variations should instruct a language model (not a child) to generate learning guides for third-grade students.",
    "content_template": "Return exactly one JSON array of {num_prompt_variations} prompt variations for the base prompt input. Each prompt must be a concise instruction to an LLM for generating a learning guide for third-grade students. In each variation, you must include the exact word “guide”, and include either “third-grade” or “third-grader”. Do **not** use synonyms like 'manual', 'walkthrough', 'tutorial', or 'primer'. Every prompt must contain the literal word “guide”. IMPORTANT: Do not add any explanations or formatting outside the JSON array. Output format: [\"prompt_variation_1\", \"prompt_variation_2\", ...] Make sure the output is formatted as a list (no headers)."
