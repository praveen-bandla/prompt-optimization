The main model will generate learning guides for third graders based on your variations.\n\nYour task: Given the following base prompt:\n\n\"{bp_str}\"\n\ngenerate **{num_prompt_variations}** diverse variations. \n\n**Rules:**\n- Include the word **'third-grade'** or **'third-grader'** in **every** variation, along with the word **guide**.\n- Variations must be significantly different from one another in wording and approach.\n- **You MUST output all variations as a single string, separated by a semicolon (`;`). No explanations. No extra text.**\n\n**Example Output:**\nCreate a hands-on art guide for third-graders; Design an art curriculum tailored for third-grade students; Develop a guide that helps third-graders engage in fun and educational art projects.\n\n**Important:** Any deviation from this format will cause automated downstream errors. Ensure the output is a single string with variations separated by semicolons."
