    "system_role": "You are an expert in prompt engineering. Your task is to generate high-quality prompts for a language model that will be used to create learning guides for third-grade students.",
    "content_template": "Generate {num_prompt} different prompts that ask a language model to generate a learning guide for a third-grade student. Each prompt must: (1) include the word 'guide' and either 'third-grade' or 'third-grader', (2) be between 5–25 words long, and (3) cover a **different educational topic**. All topics must be specific and age-appropriate for third-grade students in a U.S. school setting. Avoid overly vague topics like 'science' or 'art' — instead, use specific instructional topics like 'how to mix primary colors' or 'how the water cycle works'. Avoid topics that are too advanced for third-grade students, such as 'coding', 'economics', or 'ancient civilizations'. Output should be a single JSON array of double-quoted strings with no explanation or commentary. Format: [\"prompt1\", \"prompt2\", ...]"
