Generate Base Prompts

This script generates a set of base prompts by calling a model to produce base prompts based on
the provided input. It runs inference and generates 'n' base prompts for further use.

Inputs:
- `base_prompt_input.txt`: A text file containing the base instruction for generating prompts.
- `base_prompt_config.yaml`: A YAML file with configuration settings for prompt generation.

Outputs:
- Opens and writes the generated prompts to `base_prompts.parquet` in Parquet format for efficient storage. 
  The output includes `bp_idx`, which is a tuple in the format `(index, -1)`, where `index` is an integer 
  between 1 and `n`, representing the nth entry. Each entry will also include a string `base_prompt: str`.

Usage:
- Ensure that both input files (`base_prompt_input.txt` and `base_prompt_config.yaml`) are in the same
  directory as the script before running it.
- The generated prompts will be saved to a Parquet file named `base_prompts.parquet`.

Dependencies:
- [List of libraries or modules, e.g. 'pandas', 'transformers', 'torch', etc.]
