Main Model Inference

This script performs model inference on a given prompt, handling both prompt variations and base prompts.
It reads an instruction file and a configuration file, generates the corresponding output, and writes 
the results to the appropriate Parquet file.

Inputs:
- `bpv_idx`: An integer representing the prompt variation's index.
- `prompt variation`: A string containing the input prompt to be processed.
- `main_model_input.txt`: A text file containing instructions for inference.
- `main_model_config.yaml`: A YAML file specifying model parameters and settings.

Outputs:
- Writes the generated output to a Parquet file named `model_outputs_{i}_{j}.parquet`, which contains results 
  for prompts indexed from `(1, 0)` to `(1, k)`, where `k` is the batch/partition size of the file. 
  `i` is the index of the base prompt, and `j` is the batch number.
Example format:
| bpv_idx | model inference |
|---------|------------------|
| (1, 0)  | "Model output 1" |
| (1, 1)  | "Model output 2" |
| ...     | ...              |

Process:
1. Reads the instruction and configuration files.
2. Performs inference using the provided prompt.
3. Opens or creates the corresponding Parquet file.
4. Writes the generated output along with its corresponding index.

Dependencies:
