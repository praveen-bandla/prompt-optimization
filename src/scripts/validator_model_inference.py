Validator Model Inference

This script evaluates model-generated outputs by running inference on three different validator models. 
It assigns scores based on predefined rubric sections and writes the results to Parquet files.

Inputs:
- `base_prompt`: A string containing the original base prompt.
- `main_model_output`: The output generated by the main model.
- `val_model_input.txt`: A text file containing instructions for validation.
- `validator_model_config.yaml`: A YAML configuration file specifying parameters for the validator models.

Outputs:
- Writes validation scores to a Parquet file named `validator_scores_{n}.parquet`, where `n` is the index 
  of the base prompt.
- The output structure consists of **five columns**, each representing a **rubric section**. 
  - Each column contains a **tuple of three values**, corresponding to scores assigned by the three validator models.
Example format:
| bpv_idx | rubric_section_1 | rubric_section_2 | rubric_section_3 | rubric_section_4 | rubric_section_5 |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| (1, 0)  | (2, 3, 1)        | (1, 2, 3)        | (3, 1, 2)        | (3, 3, 3)        | (2, 2, 2)        |
| (1, 1)  | (3, 2, 1)        | (2, 1, 3)        | (1, 3, 2)        | (2, 2, 3)        | (3, 1, 1)        |
| ...     | ...              | ...              | ...              | ...              | ...              |
  

Process:
1. Reads the base prompt and corresponding main model output.
2. Loads validation instructions and model configurations.
3. Runs inference on all three validator models.
4. Computes a set of scores based on the rubric.
5. Writes the structured results to a dedicated Parquet file for each base prompt.
